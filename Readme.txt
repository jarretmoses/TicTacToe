Code challenge for my Flatiron School interview. Uploading it for practice on github and also to maybe provide some guidance to people needing help but I would highly suggest doing it on your own so you actually understand what is happening

Update: 7/14 - Added my submitted file TTT.rb (TicTacToe.rb was not the corret file) - To run type ruby TTT.rb inot your command line and enjoy!
